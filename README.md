## 🦎 Adaptive Architecture (One App, Three Modes)

Landseek-Amphibian automatically detects device capabilities to choose the best operating mode:

### 1. **Host Mode** (High-End / Pixel 10)
*   **Active:** On devices with powerful NPUs/TPUs (Pixel 9/10, S25, etc.).
*   **Function:** Runs the full **Gemma 3 4B** model locally via MediaPipe LLM Inference.
*   **Role:** Acts as a P2P Server, hosting the chatroom and agents for itself and others.
*   **Privacy:** 100% offline capable.

### 2. **Client Mode** (Standard Devices)
*   **Active:** On older phones or when battery saver is on.
*   **Function:** Connects to a remote brain (Jules, Context7, or a local P2P Host).
*   **Role:** Acts as a UI/Sensor terminal. It exposes its tools (Camera, SMS) to the remote brain but doesn't do the heavy thinking.

### 3. **Collective Mode** 🆕 (Distributed AI)
*   **Active:** When multiple devices pool their resources together.
*   **Function:** Distributes AI inference across all participating devices.
*   **Role:** Each device contributes processing power to a shared "Collective Brain".
*   **Benefits:**
    - Handle larger models than any single device could run alone
    - Fault-tolerant: tasks automatically reassign if a device disconnects
    - Optimized for high-latency networks with adaptive timeouts
    - Speculative execution hides network delays

## 🌐 Collective Mode

Pool AI processing power across multiple devices to achieve more than any single device could alone. Perfect for:
- Running inference on compute-heavy tasks
- Groups of friends wanting to share AI capabilities
- Building resilient AI systems that survive device failures

### Starting a Collective Pool

```
You: /collective
🌐 Collective pool started!
   Pool: Amphibian Collective
   Port: 8766
   Share code: Y29sbGVjdGl2ZToxOTIuMTY4LjEuMTAwOjg3NjY6YWJjMTIz
   Others can join with: /pool Y29sbGVjdGl2ZToxOTIuMTY4LjEuMTAwOjg3NjY6YWJjMTIz
```

### Joining a Collective Pool

```
You: /pool Y29sbGVjdGl2ZToxOTIuMTY4LjEuMTAwOjg3NjY6YWJjMTIz
✅ Joined collective pool "Amphibian Collective"!
   Device ID: abc123def456
   Total devices: 3
   Your device is now contributing to collective inference.
```

### Collective Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/collective [port] [name]` | Start a new collective pool |
| `/pool <share_code>` | Join an existing collective pool |
| `/unpool` | Leave the collective pool |
| `/poolstatus` | Show collective pool status |
| `/capability <level>` | Set device capability (low/medium/high/tpu) |
| `/usecollective` | Use collective brain for next inference |

### How Collective Mode Handles High Latency

Collective Mode is designed from the ground up to work even with high network latency and delays:

1. **Asynchronous Task Queuing**: Tasks are queued and distributed to available devices, not blocked waiting for responses.

2. **Adaptive Timeouts**: Timeouts automatically adjust based on historical device latency. Slow but reliable devices are given more time.

3. **Redundant Execution**: Critical tasks are sent to multiple devices. The first successful result is used, providing fault tolerance.

4. **Chunked Processing**: Long inference tasks are broken into smaller chunks that can be distributed and processed in parallel.

5. **Speculative Execution**: While waiting for responses, the system can pre-process likely follow-up requests.

6. **Partial Results**: If a task times out but has partial results, those are used rather than failing completely.

7. **Device Reliability Scoring**: Devices that frequently fail or timeout are deprioritized for future tasks.

## 🎓 Distributed Training

Pool compute resources across devices to train AI models together. Perfect for:
- Fine-tuning models on custom data
- LoRA/adapter training with limited hardware
- Collaborative learning across a team

### Starting Distributed Training

1. **Start a collective pool** (coordinator device):
```
You: /collective
🌐 Collective pool started!
   Share code: Y29sbGVjdGl2ZToxOTIuMTY4...
```

2. **Start training** (on coordinator):
```
You: /train
🎓 Distributed training started!
   Model: amphibian-lora
   Batch size: 4
   Learning rate: 0.0001
```

3. **Join training** (worker devices):
```
You: /jointrain Y29sbGVjdGl2ZToxOTIuMTY4...
🎓 Joined training as worker!
   Your device will contribute gradients to training.
```

### Training Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/train` | Start distributed training as coordinator |
| `/jointrain <share_code>` | Join training as a worker |
| `/trainstatus` | Show training progress |
| `/stoptrain` | Stop training |

### How Distributed Training Works

1. **Coordinator** distributes training batches to workers
2. **Workers** compute gradients locally using their hardware
3. **Gradients** are submitted back to coordinator
4. **Coordinator** aggregates gradients (weighted by staleness)
5. **Updated weights** are broadcast to all workers
6. Repeat until training completes

### Training Features for High Latency

- **Stale Gradient Handling**: Gradients computed on older weights are weighted lower but still used
- **Gradient Compression**: Sparsification reduces network overhead
- **Async Updates**: Workers don't need to wait for synchronization
- **Automatic Checkpointing**: Progress is saved periodically
- **Fault Tolerance**: Training continues if workers disconnect

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android 10+ (API 29+)
- For TPU inference: Pixel 6+ or compatible device with NPU
- Node.js v22+ ARM64 binary (bundled in assets)

### Building

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/Landseek-Amphibian.git
cd Landseek-Amphibian
```

2. Set up the Node.js runtime:
```bash
./scripts/setup_runtime.sh
```

3. Install bridge dependencies:
```bash
cd bridge
npm install
cd ..
```

4. Build the Android APK:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Running

1. Install the APK on your device
2. Grant required permissions (SMS, Phone, Location as needed)
3. The agent automatically starts and initializes the TPU model
4. Chat with your on-device AI!

## 🔑 Environment Variables

For external brain connections, set these before building:

```bash
export JULES_API_KEY="your-jules-api-key"
export STITCH_API_KEY="your-stitch-api-key"  
export CONTEXT7_API_KEY="your-context7-api-key"
```

## 🔨 Build Instructions

### Quick Build (One Command)

```bash
./scripts/build_release.sh
```

### Manual Build

1. **Set up Node.js runtime:**
```bash
./scripts/setup_runtime.sh
```

2. **Bundle bridge code:**
```bash
./scripts/bundle_bridge.sh
```

3. **Build the APK:**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

4. **Install on device:**
```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Build Requirements

- **JDK 17+** - Required for Gradle
- **Android SDK 34** - Target API level
- **Node.js** (host machine) - For installing bridge dependencies

### Signing for Release

To sign the APK for Play Store distribution:

1. Generate a keystore:
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore amphibian.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias amphibian
```

2. Create `android/local.properties`:
```properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/android/sdk
storeFile=../amphibian.jks
storePassword=your_password
keyAlias=amphibian
keyPassword=your_password
```

3. Update `android/app/build.gradle` to use release signing config.

## 🔒 Security

- **Localhost Binding:** The Node server binds ONLY to `127.0.0.1` to prevent external access.
- **Token Auth:** WebSocket connections require a secret token passed from Android.
- **API Keys:** Keys stored in Android KeyStore, passed to Node process via Environment Variables.
- **Scoped Storage:** File access restricted to app sandbox by default.
